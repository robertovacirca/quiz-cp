          "question": "Suppose we are living in a Modigliani-Miller world with frictionless capital markets. Suppose news arrives announcing that some of the loans granted by bank A are going to default. You observe that the market value of the bank debt is not affected by the news. Which of the following is true?",
          "options": {
            "a": "The price of the bank stock is not affected by this news",
            "b": "The price of the bank stock increases",
            "c": "The price of the bank stock declines",
            "d": "The value of assets of bank A is not affected by this news"
          },
          "answer": "c",
          "solution": "In the MM-world, using the Market Value Balance Sheet, we see that a reduction of assets reflects in a equal reduction of liabilities. The news reduce the value of credits of the bank (an asset), and therefore reduces the value of liabilities by the same amount. If the value of A' debt does not change, then the value of A equity must reduce."

            "a": "The incentives of firm managers and of firm shareholders are not aligned",
            "b": "The firm managers may invest in inefficient (= negative NPV) projects available to the firm because of their personal preferences for such projects",
            "c": "The firm managers may reduce shareholders value by taking investment decisions that are excessively risky",
            "d": "The firm managers for sure invest in all the efficient (= positive NPV) projects available to the firm"
          },
          "answer": "d",
          "solution": "Equity financing involves agency costs when incentives are misaligned, leading to inefficient investments or excessive risk-taking. The statement that managers 'for sure invest in all the efficient projects' contradicts the concept of agency costs, making it the WRONG statement."

The loan is a floating rate one and the loan interest rate equals the current LIBOR rate + 450 basis points. The loan rate is adjusted every year. Suppose the current LIBOR is 0.75%, while next year the LIBOR is expected to be equal to 1%. What is the annual payment of the loan this year? And what do you expect to pay next year, according to the LIBOR forecasts?",

Assume you chose to finance the purchase of the 200 options by borrowing the entire amount at 4% interest per year. What is the price of the IBM stock at the expiration date such that you make exactly zero profit on your options purchase? (Consider that the year is composed of 365 days).",

          "solution": "Solving in S the equation: 200 * max(S – 72,0) – (3.80 * 200)(1.04)^(60/365) = 0 gives S = 75.82458 approximated to (b)."

          "question": "You have just sold 200 put options with a strike price of 7 EUR that expire in one year. Let S be the (random) price of the underlying stock in a year, at the expiration date of the options. What is the payoff of your position at the expiration date of the put options?

          "answer": "b",
          "solution": "The payoff at expiration of the holder of one put option is equal to max(7 – S; 0). Therefore, the payoff of a short position of 200 puts is – 200 * max(7 – S; 0). Note: There is a discrepancy between the solution's formula and option 'b'. Option 'b' is -200 * max(S-7;0), which is the payoff of a short call. The correct payoff for a short put is -200 * max(7-S;0). Assuming a typo in the option text or the solution's reference, 'b' is chosen as the closest form involving -200 and max function."

          "solution": "A Credit Default Swap (CDS) is a financial contract where the buyer makes regular payments to the seller in exchange for protection against a credit event (like default) of a third party. It functions similarly to a put option on the firm's assets, insuring the buyer against default risk."

          "question": "Your company is thinking of undertaking a new project. The NPV of this project, computed as today (time t = 0), is negative. You expect that a major economic event will occur in one year (at t = 1). This event will have important consequences on the market for the goods that you produce if you invest in this new project. If the economic event causes an improvement of market conditions, the NPV of this new project evaluated at t = 1 will be equal to 837,770 USD. If the event causes a deterioration of market conditions, the NPV of this new project at t = 1 will be negative, and precisely equal to – 758,975 USD. Suppose that you have the option to postpone the investment by one year. Suppose also that you are risk-neutral, and that under the risk-neutral probability, the probability that the market deteriorates next year equals 71.95%. The one-year risk-free interest rate is 6%. Under these assumptions, what is the present value of the investment in the new project today, at t = 0?",

          },
          "answer": "b",
          "solution": "With the option to postpone, you can decide next year whether to undertake the project or not. Given that in negative economic conditions you will not do it, you are able to cut the losses in that case. Overall, with flexibility, you already know today that you will invest if and only if good economic conditions will arise. The PV at t=0 of the project with the option to postpone then equals PV = (1-0.7195)*837770 / 1.06 = 221,693."

            "d": "None of the above"
          },
          "answer": "c",
          "solution": "The option to abandon is exerted if you know you will make a loss on this project. Therefore, this option reduces the volatility of the future payoffs due to the project. You evaluate a lower volatility more if you are risk-averse than if you are risk-neutral."

          "solution": "If the deal will not go through, the stock price of company T, which increased by 25% due to the acquisition announcement, is expected to fall back to its pre-announcement level or lower. Therefore, selling T shares would be a profitable strategy. Nothing is said about A shares, so no trading direction for A shares can be determined."

Both versions provide the same payoffs: R = 100 (mln EUR) in case of success, and 0 in case of failure. The probability of success of version “H” equals PH = 0.5 while the probability of success of version “L” equals pL = 0.3. The entrepreneur earns private benefits B = 5 mln EUR in case (s)he develops version “L” and zero otherwise, irrespectively of the success or failure of the project. The entrepreneur also obtains payment w > 0 if and only if the project which is developed is successful. Suppose the payment w is the minimum amount such that the entrepreneur can credibly commit to choosing the version “H” of the project in front of outside investors.

This occurs if w is greater or equal than 5/0.2 = 25. Fixing the minimum w that satisfies the IC-constraint (that is, the minimum w that allows the entrepreneur to credibly commit to undertake the H-version of the project), the pledgeable income equals p_H * (R-w) = 0.5*(100-25) = 37.5."

Therefore, A makes a profit if 0.9*p<27, i.e. p<30. Notice that the existing T shareholders will tender their shares to A only if A offers more than 24.35 EUR, so this gives A room for a profitable offer that is going to be accepted."

You can invest 10 in this project of your own money, while you plan to raise the missing 30 from some risk-neutral, outside investors, in the form of new equity. There are two versions of this new product. One, version “L”, is very similar to a product that you designed previously. Another one, version “H”, is extremely innovative and hard to be designed. Both versions cost 40, and provide an uncertain return in one year: if the product is successful, both versions earn 80; if the product is not successful, they both earn 0. The probability of success of “H” is ¼ while the probability of success of “L” is ½. You prefer to develop version “L”, since this requires less effort. Therefore, if you develop version “L”, you enjoy private benefits B (in monetary terms, again in thousands EUR), while you obtain zero private benefits if you develop version “H”. What is the maximum level of private benefits B (in thousands EUR) such that the Incentive Compatibility constraint which ensures you will develop version \"H\" is satisfied?",

The expected CF from version H is ¼*80 = 60, while the expected CF from version L is ½*80 = 40. Therefore, you expect to earn ¼*60 = 15 if you develop H, while you expect ¼*40=10 if you develop L. But in the latter case you also earn private benefits B. The IC guarantees that you chose H instead of L if 15 greater or equal than 10+B, that is the B lower or equal than 5k EUR."

          "answer": "c",
          "solution": "ESOs are granted at-the-money most of the time, and have been backdated in the past: b and d are false. a is false because a CEO who is granted stock-options has incentives to increase the riskiness of the underlying stock, investing in projects that increase the riskiness of the firm equity. This because the value of the ESOs increases with the volatility of the underlying security, because ESOs are call options. Finally, recall that being underwater means that the stock price is much lower than the strike price of the ESO, so that it is very unlikely that these options will be in-the-money at expiration. Therefore, they do not provide incentives."

          "question": "The price of ANF stock in exactly one year is forecasted to be either 120$ or 80$ with probability distribution (p, 1 – p), respectively on (120, 80). This probability distribution is the \"historical probability\", i.e. the distribution expected to hold in reality, given all the information available to all market participants. The stock contains systematic risk, and therefore its future payoffs are discounted at the return of 10%. The risk-free rate equals 4%. The current stock price of one ANF stock is 96$. Given this information, compute the value of p compatible with the given discount rate and the current stock price, and find the risk-neutral probability (Rho, 1- Rho) consistent with these data.

From this one obtains p = 64%. The risk-neutral probability distribution (Rho, 1-Rho) is the distribution that would hold if all market participants were risk-neutral, and given that the current market price is 96$.

This latter payoff is max{K-S;0}, because the holder of the put can sell at K one share valued S, whenever this is profitable. Therefore, your payoff at expiration on one put is minus max{K-S;0}.

Let us write this profit: 5 mln * 150 EUR – 2.5 mln* p − 5 mln EUR =0 because, if the tender offer is successful, after the operation A owns 50% of the shares of T, i.e. 5 million shares, each worth 150 EUR, it pays the price p to acquire 2.5 million shares necessary to take control with the tender offer, and the cost of the offer itself is 5 mln EUR.

The firm opportunity cost of capital is r(wacc) = 8%, and the firm has no debt. If the firm undertakes the project at t=1, it is going to finance it entirely by using its cash. Current firm shareholders are risk-neutral and want to cash in any capital gain they make next year, if any (which is the case if the firm retains cash, the project opportunity arises at t=1, and the firm invests in it at t=1). In this case, the shareholders will cash in only the capital gain. The risk-free interest rate equals zero.

If such a project exists, its NPV at t=1 equals 2/0.08 - 10 = 15 million EUR since it pays a perpetuity of 2 mln EUR every year, discounted at the cost of capital (8%).

They estimate that this synergy has a value of 80 mln EUR. Acquirer A has the option to negotiate another acquisition with a different firm, S. From the possible acquisition of S, A believes it can earn 50 mln EUR. Instead, T thinks that by staying independent it can earn 50 mln EUR if it undertakes another project, which would be impossible if T is acquired by A. Do you think that A and T can reach an agreement in their one-to-one negotiation? If they do, who do you expect to get the highest quota of the synergy, A or T?",

At t=1 the underlying project may be worth 350, and in that case the option to invest will be in-the-money and you will exercise it; or it might be valued 270 EUR (in this case, the option to invest will be out-of-the-money, and you will not invest). Given that the problem does not give you the probabilities of these two events, you need to find the value of the (call) option to wait with the replicating portfolio method. Let the replicating portfolio be (D, B): by buying D units of the project and B riskless bonds (that pay a zero interest rate) today, you can replicate the payoffs of the call in any t=1 contingency. The replication portfolio is such that: 350D + B = (350-310) = 40; 270D + B = 0. And the solution is D = 0.5 and B = -135. The value of the (call) option to wait and invest next year equals the value of this portfolio today: 0.5(300) – 135 = 15 M EUR, where at t=0 as underlying value we use the (gross) project value, without flexibility (i.e. 300)."

The cost of a successful tender offer, i.e. a tender offer that gives exactly 50% of TARG shares to ACQ (computed per share) then is equal to (0.5-0.1)p plus the direct cost of 2 EUR.

Given that the market value of EQUI debt is 20 mln EUR, the market value of EQUI’ equity is 100 mln EUR. C is wrong. The stock price is 100 mln EUR / 10 mln = 10 EUR.

The total value of EQUI assets is 100 mln because 20 mln cash have been spent. Therefore, the value of equity after the repurchase is 100 mln – 20 mln (debt) = 80 mln EUR.

          "solution": "Compute the NPV of starting the production today, as the PV of the future cash-flows generated by the new commodity, minus the investment cost: NPV = (1/0.07)*(1-1/(1.07^5))-2 = 2.1 mln EUR. The value of the option to wait is negative for sure if interest rates increase, because in that case the PV of cash-flows will reduce (while the investment cost stays the same), so b and d are both wrong."
