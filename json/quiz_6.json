            "b": "Decrease.",
            "c": "Remain unchanged.",
            "d": "Become equal to the cost of debt."
          },
          "answer": "c",
          "solution": "According to MM Proposition II without taxes, in a frictionless market, the WACC remains constant regardless of the capital structure."
        },
        {
          "question": "According to Modigliani-Miller Proposition I with corporate taxes, the market value of a levered firm ($V_L$) is equal to the market value of an identical unlevered firm ($V_U$) plus:",

          },
          "answer": "b",
          "solution": "Corporate taxes make debt advantageous because interest payments are tax-deductible, creating a \"tax shield\" that adds value to the levered firm."
        },
        {
          "question": "In a Modigliani-Miller world (without taxes), a company's stock price after an open market share repurchase has no effect on the stock price per share. This resulting price is equivalent to what if a cash dividend were paid instead?",

          "question": "A firm has operating assets-in-place with a market value of €180 million. It also holds €50 million in cash. The firm has debt with a market value of €70 million. What is the current total market value of the firm?",

          },
          "answer": "c",
          "solution": "The total market value of the firm is the sum of its operating assets and its cash holdings: €180M (assets-in-place) + €50M (cash) = €230M. Debt is a claim on these assets and doesn't directly add to the firm's total value in this sum."

          "question": "In a frictionless Modigliani-Miller market, if you observe $V_U > V_L$ (where $V_U$ is the value of an unlevered firm and $V_L$ is the value of an otherwise identical levered firm), which arbitrage action would you take?",

          },
          "answer": "a",
          "solution": "To exploit $V_U > V_L$ (unlevered firm is overpriced), you sell the overpriced asset (shares of U) and synthetically buy the underpriced asset (shares and bonds of L)."

          "question": "When valuing the expected future cash flows of a **risky** project for risk-averse investors, the appropriate discount rate used should:",

            "d": "Be higher if the project is financed with more equity, due to equity's higher risk."
          },
          "answer": "b",
          "solution": "Risk-averse investors demand extra compensation (a risk premium) for bearing systematic risk. This premium is added to the risk-free rate to form the discount rate."

        {
          "question": "A firm has debt with a face value of €8M due in one year. The owner has limited liability. The firm considers two strategies:\n1.  **Strategy A:** Firm value in 1 year = €7M (certain).\n2.  **Strategy B:** Firm value in 1 year = €12M (prob 50%) or €4M (prob 50%).\nWhich strategy yields the owner a higher expected payoff?",
