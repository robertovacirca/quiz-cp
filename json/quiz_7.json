          "question": "A newly established firm with no assets invests €10M in a project that has a positive NPV of €3M. Which of the following statements is/are true?",
          "options": {
            "a": "The total market value of the firm's assets after the investment is €10M.",
            "b": "The firm's total market value increases by €3M.",
            "c": "The total market value of the firm's assets after the investment is €13M.",
            "d": "The project's cost equals its NPV."
          },
          "answer": "b",
          "solution": "B and C. Explanation: The total market value of the firm's assets is the project's cost (€10M) plus the value it creates (NPV of €3M), for a total of €13M. The firm's value increases by the NPV (€3M) above its cost."

          "question": "In a Modigliani-Miller world (without taxes), a firm uses excess cash to repurchase shares. Which of the following statement(s) is/are true regarding the stock price?",
          "options": {
            "a": "The share price is unaffected and remains constant after the repurchase.",
            "b": "The share price after the repurchase equals the stock's cum-dividend price.",
            "c": "The share price after the repurchase equals the stock's ex-dividend price.",
            "d": "The total market value of the firm remains unchanged after the repurchase."
          },
          "answer": "a",
          "solution": "A and B. Explanation: A share repurchase leaves the price per share unaffected (A is true). Based on the specific lecture slides we reviewed, this price is equivalent to the cum-dividend price (B is true). The ex-dividend price would be lower. The total market value of the firm decreases by the cash distributed (D is false)."

          },
          "answer": "a",
          "solution": "A, B, and D. Explanation: In a world with corporate taxes, debt's interest deductibility adds value (D) and lowers the WACC (B), making the levered firm more valuable than the unlevered one (A). The value is no longer independent of capital structure (C is false)."

          },
          "answer": "a",
          "solution": "A, B, and C. Explanation: The unlevered firm is overpriced, so you sell it (A). To create a synthetic unlevered firm, you buy the components of the levered firm (B and C). D is impossible as the unlevered firm has no bonds."

          },
          "answer": "a",
          "solution": "A, C, and D. Explanation: Limited liability caps the owner's losses (A is true). If the firm is distressed, debtholders bear the downside risk of a new project (C is true), which incentivizes the owner to gamble (D is true). This causes the owner's NPV to differ from the firm's (B is false)."

          },
          "answer": "a",
          "solution": "A, B, and C. Explanation: Debt overhang is an underinvestment problem (A) that arises because debtholders have a senior claim (B), causing them to capture a portion of the project's NPV, which can make the project unprofitable for shareholders (C). It leads to shareholders avoiding investment (underinvestment), not favoring low-risk projects (D is false, that would be risk-shifting's opposite)."

          "question": "A firm offers €50/share to acquire 40% of a target with 10M shares outstanding. It already owns 10%. Post-takeover price is €60. Administrative costs are €5M. Which statement(s) is/are true?",

          "question": "An entrepreneur chooses a project that is inefficient for the firm but provides them with a private benefit. Which of the following is/are true?",

          },
          "answer": "a",
          "solution": "A and C. Explanation: This behavior is a classic agency cost (A) that directly destroys value by choosing a negative NPV project (C). The entrepreneur is not acting in shareholders' interest (B is false). D may be true in an efficient market, but it doesn't describe the act itself."
        },

          "question": "A firm can invest €1M today for a project that yields a €1.3M payoff in one year. It must repay €0.5M in debt in one year. The project is equity-financed by risk-neutral shareholders, and the risk-free rate is 0%. Which statement(s) is/are true?",

            "a": "A risk-averse investor would use a higher discount rate than a risk-neutral investor.",
            "b": "The firm's WACC is the appropriate discount rate if the project's risk matches the firm's average risk.",

            "d": "A higher beta for the project would lead to a higher discount rate."
          },
          "answer": "a",
          "solution": "A, B, and D. Explanation: A risk-averse investor demands a risk premium (A is true). WACC is used for average risk projects (B is true). Higher beta means more systematic risk, requiring a higher discount rate (D is true). Cash flows can be stochastic (C is false)."
        },
        {

          },
          "answer": "b",
          "solution": "B, C, and D. Explanation: The discount rate is the risk-free rate (A is false). But the risk adjustment is done by using risk-neutral probabilities (B is true), which embeds the risk premium (D is true). This results in the correct market price (C is true)."
        },
        {
          "question": "The current stock price is €50. In one year, it will be either €62.5 or €45. The one-year risk-free rate is 4%. What is/are the correct risk-neutral probability(ies) for these outcomes?",

          },
          "answer": "b",
          "solution": "B and D. Explanation: The total asset value increases by the project's cost plus its NPV: €10M + €5M = €15M (B is true). The new total value = €50M + €15M = €65M (D is true)."

          },
          "answer": "b",
          "solution": "B, C, and D. Explanation: It's like a put option to sell the project for its abandonment value (B). It increases the project's value by capping its downside (C). It's particularly valuable for managers who dislike risk (D). The value of an option is never negative (A is false)."

          "solution": "A, B, and D. Explanation: The payoff is capped at zero in default due to limited liability (A is true). They get the residual above the debt (B is true). The payoff can be zero, so it's not always positive (C is false). The payoff formula is the definition of a call option payoff (D is true)."

          "answer": "a",
          "solution": "A. Explanation: Waiting is valuable because it allows you to resolve uncertainty and avoid a negative outcome (A is true). It's like a call option, not a put (B is false). The option is valuable precisely when the NPV is negative but the future upside is high (C is false). It is valuable if the information gained by waiting outweighs the cost (D is false)."

For breakeven: 180M = 4M * P + 2M, so 178M = 4M * P, giving P = €44.5. The options are flawed, but if we follow the logic from the exam solution (which used a different calculation leading to 40), it would be C.
